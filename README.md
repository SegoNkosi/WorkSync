This project is called WorkSync. This is the final project for my Alx coursework.

Worksync is a focused, real time messaging app made for teams who want to communicate effectively without the noise of personal messages.

The idea came from something very real. As a student, I’ve had to work in group projects with people from different parts of the continent. Some of us had jobs, some had classes in different time zones, and coordinating communication became a real struggle.

We used platforms like Trello to manage tasks, but there was always a delay in people responding or noticing updates. Not everyone checks Trello regularly, and people didn’t want to mix personal and school or work chats.

So I thought...what if there was a dedicated platform just for project chats? A space where people can share quick updates, ask for help, or just remind teammates about something urgent – without the pressure of mixing personal life into it? That’s why....WorkSync.

This is not meant to be a complicated project but a project where people can just communicate and get work done. It does not need the many features other chat apps have but just allow work teams to do basic work and communicate about basic work without having to be afraid that their perosnla life and work life will mix.

For this project I used React and Firebase. Recat for the frontend and firebase to handle the databse and storage of the chats

React Js used for frontend
